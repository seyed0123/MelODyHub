# Description

This project consists of four different sections :
Server , Client , Database , Recommendation Engine


let's go through all the different sections and see what role do they play in the project

## Server

The application utilizes two separate servers for different functionalities. The first server handles the generation and delivery of temporary passwords during the login process. This server ensures that users receive the necessary credentials securely and reliably.

The second server is responsible for various operations, including song downloading, extraction of song images, handling follow functionalities, managing playlist creation, processing song information requests, and more. It serves as a central hub for multiple tasks related to the application's core functionalities.

To ensure data security, modern encryption methods such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) are employed. AES is a symmetric algorithm designed for efficient data encryption and decryption, while RSA is an asymmetric method primarily used for secure key exchange and digital signatures. These encryption techniques enhance the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.

Moreover, all user passwords and essential information are stored using secure hash methods. Hashing algorithms convert sensitive data into unique hash values, making it computationally infeasible to retrieve the original information from the hash. This further safeguards user passwords and essential data from unauthorized access.

By employing these encryption and hashing techniques, the application ensures a robust security framework, protecting user information and enhancing overall data privacy.

The system has been designed to log information in a way that allows it to be used through the program code itself, even in the event of a database loss. This ensures that critical information is always available and can be easily accessed when needed.



## Client

The client interface is the part of the application that users interact with. It offers a variety of functions to users, such as playing songs, sharing songs and playlists, following other users, displaying popular and recommended songs, accessing premium status, liking songs, creating playlists, and downloading songs.

Users can search for specific songs or add popular songs to their playlists or queue for playback and enjoyment. To access premium status, users must play a game of Pac-Man, which is implemented in C++ and the Pacman has been designed to run on the Docker platform, enabling universal accessibility of the program for all users. This feature allows for greater flexibility and ease of use, as users are no longer bound by the limitations of their individual operating systems or hardware configurations. If they achieve a score above a specified threshold, they unlock the premium status. With premium status, users can follow other users, view their followers and followings, and search for individuals within the application to follow.

The client interface is designed to be user-friendly and provides a range of features that enhance the overall music listening and social interaction within the application.
In addition to the features mentioned, the client interface also allows users to create and share playlists with other users, as well as like and comment on other user's playlists. This fosters a sense of community within the application and allows users to discover new music and connect with others who share similar tastes.

Another notable feature of the client interface is its recommendation system, which suggests songs and playlists based on a user's listening history and preferences. This helps users discover new music and ensures that they are always up-to-date with the latest trends and releases.

Overall, the client interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a clean and modern interface that is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. By offering a wide range of features and functions, as well as fostering a sense of community and social interaction, it provides a complete music-listening experience for users of all levels.
### Admin Status Checker:

This Flutter app has been designed to enable admins to easily check the status of the main application. The app provides a user-friendly interface that displays real-time information on the performance and availability of the application, allowing admins to quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise.

With the Admin Status Checker, admins can view detailed information on the status of key components of the main application, such as the database, server, and network connection. They can also receive alerts and notifications when issues are detected, enabling them to take immediate action to resolve any problems.

## Recommendation Engine
The system is composed of two main components: a recommendation engine and a genre classification system. The recommendation engine runs continuously, using machine learning algorithms to analyze user listening behavior and generate personalized song recommendations. Whenever a user listens to more than four songs within a specified period of time, the engine generates 15 song ID recommendations for that user and stores them in the database.

The genre classification system is responsible for ensuring that all songs in the database have accurate genre labels. When the recommendation engine generates new song recommendations, the genre classification system first checks if the recommended songs already have a genre assigned in the database. If they do, no further action is taken.

However, if the songs do not have a genre assigned, the genre classification system listens to each song and uses machine learning techniques to determine their respective genres. This process involves extracting audio features such as tempo, rhythm, and melody, and comparing them to a pre-defined set of genre templates. Based on this analysis, the system assigns one or more genre labels to each song, which are then added to the database accordingly.

By continuously analyzing user listening behavior and accurately labeling songs with their respective genres, the system is able to provide highly personalized and relevant song recommendations to users, enhancing their overall music listening experience. In addition, the system's ability to automatically classify songs with accurate genre labels also benefits music industry professionals, such as record labels and music distributors, who rely on accurate genre information to make informed decisions about marketing and distribution strategies.


## Databsae

The database used in the application is a comprehensive repository that stores a wide range of information related to the application's functionality. This includes information about users, such as their login credentials, personal details, and settings. It also includes information about artists and podcasters, such as their biographies, discographies, and other relevant details.

In addition, the database stores information about songs, including their titles, durations, genres, and other metadata. It also stores information about playlists, ownership details, shared content, and favorite items. User history is also recorded in the database, allowing users to easily access previously played songs or podcasts.

Notifications are also stored in the database, allowing users to view alerts and updates related to their account or the application itself. Song lyrics are another important piece of information that is stored in the database, allowing users to view lyrics while listening to a song.

Finally, the database stores information about user followers and followings, allowing users to connect and interact with other users who share similar tastes in music or podcasts.

The song table in the database is particularly noteworthy, as it contains over 588,000 unique song IDs along with associated information that users can listen to. This information includes details such as the song's title, artist, album, duration, and genre.

The database is populated with data before, during, and after the application's operation using Python and Java scripts. This ensures that the database is always up-to-date and accurate, reflecting the latest information about users, songs, and other relevant details. By providing a comprehensive repository of information, the database enables the application to provide a rich and engaging user experience, and ensures that users can easily find and listen to their favorite songs and podcasts.
